Stock Visualization Tool
This project provides a comprehensive tool to visualize stock data using interactive and static graphs. It processes and cleans the dataset to generate insights with the help of R libraries, including **ggplot2**, **plotly**, and **scales**. The visualizations include scatter plots and line charts, providing a deeper understanding of stock trends and performance across industries.

Features
1. Static Scatter Plot:
   - Displays the relationship between `Share.Volume` and `Percentage.Change`.
   - Includes a regression line for a better understanding of trends.
   - Data points are color-coded by `Industry`.

2. Interactive Scatter Plot:
   - Similar to the static scatter plot but enhanced with hoverable tooltips.
   - Tooltips display detailed information like `Symbol`, `Share.Volume`, `Percentage.Change`, and `Industry`.

3. Segregated Line Chart:
   - Visualizes the `Percentage.Change` over a sequential index for each industry.
   - Uses `facet_wrap` to separate trends by `Industry` into individual panels.
   - Dynamic color palette ensures visual distinction between industries.

4. Optimizations:
   - Handles missing or invalid data for smoother rendering.
   - Filters top industries or limits the dataset to improve performance on large datasets.

Requirements
- R (>= 4.0.0)
- RStudio (recommended for interactive usage)
- R Libraries:
  - **ggplot2**
  - **plotly**
  - **scales**

Setup
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required R libraries (if not already installed):
   ```R
   install.packages("ggplot2")
   install.packages("plotly")
   install.packages("scales")
   ```
3. Set the working directory to the folder containing the dataset:
   ```R
   setwd("C:/Users/Ruhi/Downloads/hsl")
   ```

How to Use
1.Prepare the Dataset:
   - Ensure the dataset file (`scatter_plot_data.csv`) is in the working directory.
   - The dataset should have the following columns:
     - `Symbol`
     - `Share.Volume`
     - `Percentage.Change`
     - `Industry`
     - `Company.Name`

2. Run the R Script:
   - Load the script into RStudio or an R environment and run each section sequentially.

3. Generate Visualizations:
   - Static Scatter Plot:
     The relationship between `Share.Volume` and `Percentage.Change` for all industries.
   - Interactive Scatter Plot:
     Rendered using `plotly`, hover over data points for detailed insights.
   - Segregated Line Chart:
     Trends in `Percentage.Change` over a sequential index, separated by industry.

4. Dynamic Updates:
   - Modify the dataset or input dynamically, and rerun the script to update the visualizations.

Code Components
Dataset Cleaning
- Removes missing or invalid values from the dataset to ensure accurate plotting.

### **Static Scatter Plot**
- Generates a static scatter plot with regression lines using `ggplot2`.

### **Interactive Scatter Plot**
- Adds interactivity with `plotly`, allowing users to explore detailed data by hovering over points.

Line Chart
- Segregates trends in `Percentage.Change` by `Industry` using `facet_wrap`.
- Optimized for performance by filtering the dataset to include the top 8 industries.

Sample Output
Static Scatter Plot
A clean plot showing stock performance trends across industries.
Interactive Scatter Plot
A dynamic version of the scatter plot with tooltips showing detailed stock information.

Line Chart
Faceted line charts highlighting trends for each industry in separate panels.

Issues and Limitations
- Performance: On very large datasets, the rendering time may increase. Optimization steps, like filtering top industries, have been included to mitigate this.
- Dataset Requirements: The dataset must include the required columns (`Symbol`, `Share.Volume`, `Percentage.Change`, `Industry`, and `Company.Name`).
- Interactive Rendering: Interactive graphs require a compatible environment (e.g., RStudio or a web browser).

Future Improvements
- Integrate with a chatbot to dynamically display graphs based on user input.
- Add support for additional visualizations like histograms or box plots.
- Improve real-time performance for large-scale datasets.
